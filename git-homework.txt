This is my bootcamp homework file

Question 1 What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the tool on your computer where you create branches, merges, and change code. GitHub is where you store files online in a centralized location.

Question 2 What’s the difference between ‘git add <file>’, ‘git add .’, and ‘git add -A?
You use "git add ‹file name>" to add a specific file you changed, "git add -A" to add everything that you just changed, and "git add." to add everything you changed inside the current directory.

Question 3 What does git push do? What does git pull do?
Git push pushes your code up to the remote branch so that everyone can see it, while git pull downloads content from a remote repository and integrates it into the local repository.
